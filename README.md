# CSE201
Group 16 Repository

Feb. 24
The first step in editing and making changes to code in github is to
make an account. I made mine using my non-miami email, though I'm
sure it would be fine either way.

Once you make an account, go back to the first link I gave you:
github.com/n4cho6/CSE201
I'm going to have you guys try to edit my Hello.java file.
This process isn't tricky necessarily, you just have to make sure
you keep pressing ok, or push, or commit, or merge, or those 
kinds of buttons. They are sometimes at the top in green, but
other times they are hidden halfway down the page. Post in the GroupMe
once you are done and I'll make sure that it pops up on my end as
a requested edit.
